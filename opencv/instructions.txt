before moving on, just delete every version of python you have on your windows computer. Search "add or remove programs" and it should come in settings. 

I installed 3.9.2 cause i think some of my older projects need it, you dont have to install 3.9.2 but thats just what i did. 

you can find it here https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/

click windows installer 64 bit? 

after downloading and opening, in the python installer that comes up, make sure you check the box that says add to path. see attached image. (ignore the python version)

go to command prompt. do python --version and see if it returns 3.9.2. if it does great, if not let me know. 

if that works, try running pip install opencv-python

if that suceeds, try the code that i attached. it should open your webcam and also have a weird thick line drawn on it lol.
